# hacktoberfest

SuDO Consultants is participating officially in Hacktoberfest 2020. We have decided to not only encourage our team to participate but we are offering them incentives and bonuses if they do participate.

We have decided to extend the same to opensource contributors who from their busy time make opensource possible and allow us to use all these useful software which has not only shaped the industry but has made possible all the innovation we see today, from startups to big enterprises.
